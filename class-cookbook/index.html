        <h1>vegan chocolate mousse</h1>
        <h2>naturally sweetened, dairy free mousse</h2>
        <p>ingredients:</p>
        <ul id="ingredients">
            <li>cocoa butter (or vegan bittersweet/dark chocolate)</li>
            <li>cacao powder</li>
            <li>coconut milk</li>
            <li>dates</li>
            <li>sea salt</li>
            <li>vanilla extract</li>
            <li>sugar/stevia</li>
        </ul>
        <p>instructions:</p>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine cocoa or cacao powder, carob powder (optional), cocoa butter, salt, and 3/4 cup coconut milk (180 ml // as recipe is written // if altering batch size, use approximately 2/3 of the coconut milk for this step). Begin warming over medium-low heat, whisking to combine.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture is melted, add remaining coconut milk and whisk until fully combined. Then remove from heat and add vanilla and stevia to taste (or just add more dates).</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a blender (I used a Magic Bullet, but any smaller high-speed blender should also work). Add dates (start with 5 and increase to taste), and blend on high until creamy and smooth. (At this time, you could also add other flavors, such as peppermint oil for chocolate-mint or peanut butter for peanut butter-chocolate.)</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cacao powder for rich chocolate flavor, dates for sweetness, or sea salt for saltiness.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a bowl and cover. Refrigerate until cold and thickened â€“ at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>To serve, enjoy as is or divide between serving glasses and top with coconut whipped cream, raspberries, and chopped vegan dark chocolate or cacao/cocoa powder (optional).</li>
            <li>Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
