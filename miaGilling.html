      Ashley spends a lot of time on TikTok, her most used app, to scroll endlessly when she wakes up <br>
      and to manage the account for the makeup brand she works for, Fluide. She also uses a lot of streaming <br>
      apps like Hulu and HBO Max because she loves watching America's Next Top Model while eating dinner.

	 <!-- In the quotes below, copy and paste a quote from the person you interviewed.  -->
	<blockquote>
    “My current favorite app is Pinterest because it helps me relax when I’m feeling anxious. <br>
    I love making boards for my friends that are inspired by them, or inspiration boards for <br> 
    my dream house or tattoos I want. It’s a good place to dream about things that you want <br>
    to do and get inspiration.” <br> —Ashley Fletcher
