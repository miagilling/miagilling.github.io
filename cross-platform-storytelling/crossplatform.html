            <p> 'Politicians In My Eyes' is a song, so I thought that <br>
            creating a playlist on Spotify to spell out the lyrics<br>
            through songs would be fitting. I also created a cover <br>
            for the playlist that was inspired by a different punk <br>
            band's album cover, The Jam, to give the playlist the <br>
            feeling of almost being an entirely new punk album.

            Zines were huge during the punk movement, and<br>
            I took inspiration from 70s punk music zines to<br>
            create a digital zine of the song's lyrics on Instagram. <br>
            each post is supposed to represent a different page, <br>
            while the account as a whole is the full zine itself.

            <p>
            Twitter was the first platform I thought of for<br>
            this song because of the song's political commentary.<br>
            I'm constantly seeing people voicing their political<br>
            opinions on Twitter, so I thought it would be a very<br>
            fitting platform to post the lyrics of a politically<br>
            charged punk song.
