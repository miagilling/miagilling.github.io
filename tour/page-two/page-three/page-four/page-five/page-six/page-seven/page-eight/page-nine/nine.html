        <h1>the floor</h1>
        <h2>i really love working on my floor for some reason, so it has become a very important part of my apartment</h2>
        <p>i have a rug by my window that i always sit on, and one of my favorite things to do on the floor is play guitar and record music.</p>
        <p>whenever i do this, i'll set up a makeshift home recording setup on my floor, and there will be equipment and instruments scattered all over the place, so for this page, i want to show an overhead view of the rug and everything that accumulates on it</p>
