        <h1>"living room"</h1>
        <h2>since a studio is one big space, i don't have rooms so i designate different spots for different things</h2>
        <p>my "living room" is one of my favorite spots, mainly because of my poster wall, a collection of band posters that spans half of the length of my apartment which helps divide the space</p>
        <p>i loooove my poster wall, so i want to recreate it for this page</p>
