        <h1>my window</h1>
        <h2>one of my favorite spots in my apartment!! i have west-facing windows, so i get to watch the sunset every night</h2>
        <p>because i'm obsessed with watching the sunset, i have quite a large collection of sunset photos (from my window) so i want this page to be a gallery of them</p>
       
        <div class="window">
            <img src="images/sunset1.jpeg" width="50%">
            <p>this will be the 'window,' and inside will be a gallery of sunset photos that users can click through so they can feel like they're looking out my window</p>
