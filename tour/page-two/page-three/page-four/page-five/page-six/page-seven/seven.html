        <h1>my dining table/desk</h1>
        <h2>i have a circular table in the middle of my apartment that i use for a lot of different things</h2>
        <p>i eat here, i do zoom calls, work on projects, make art, use it as a catch-all area for my keys, purse, etc when i get home</p>
        <p>i want to show all of the different ways i use this space by letting users toggle through different modes for the table</p>
        <p>i'll have a certain collection of items appear on the table each time a button is clicked, or have different buttons correspond to the different modes</p>
