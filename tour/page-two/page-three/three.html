        <h1>bathroom!</h1>
        <h2>most of my time in the bathroom is spent taking long, hot showers to de-stress</h2>
        <div class="mirror">
            <p>if this isn't too hard to do, i want to try and recreate the feeling of writing on a fogged-up mirror digitally</p>
            <p>maybe using a grey, mirror-looking box with blur over it that goes away when your cursor hovers over it?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lightswitch">
            <p>not sure if i want to do this, but maybe the page will start out black except for one button that you can click to 'turn on the lights'</p>
            <p>black will go away on click and then you'll see the 'mirror' ??</p>
        </div>
