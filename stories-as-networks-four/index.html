        <div id="one">
            <p>In 1978 I released the first record which described itself as Ambient Music, <br>a name I invented to describe an emerging musical style.</p>   
        </div>
  
        <div id="two">
            <p>It happened like this. <br>In the early seventies, more and more people were changing the way they were listening to music. <br>Records and radio had been around long enough for some of the novelty to wear off,<br> and people were wanting to make quite particular and sophisticated choices about <br>what they played in their homes and workplaces, <br>what kind of sonic mood they surrounded themselves with.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="three">
            <p>The manifestation of this shift was a movement away from the assumptions <br>that still dominated record-making at the time — that people had short attention <br>spans and wanted a lot of action and variety, clear rhythms and song structures <br>and, most of all, voices. To the contrary, I was noticing that my friends <br>and I were making and exchanging long cassettes of music chosen for its stillness, <br>homogeneity, lack of surprises and, most of all, lack of variety. <br>We wanted to use music in a different way-as part of the ambience <br>of our lives — and we wanted it to be continuous, a surrounding.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="four">
            <p>At the same time there were other signs on the horizon. <br>Because of the development of recording technology, a whole host of compositional possibilities <br>that were quite new to music came into existence. Most of these <br>had to do with two closely related new areas — the development <br>of the texture of sound itself as a focus for compositional attention, <br>and the ability to create with electronics virtual acoustic spaces <br>(acoustic spaces that don’t exist in nature).
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="five">
            <p>When you walk into a recording studio, you see thousands of <br>knobs and controls. Nearly all of these are different ways of doing the same job: they allow<br> you to do things to sounds, to make them fatter or thinner or <br>shinier or rougher or harder or smoother or punchier or more liquid <br>or any one of a thousand other things. So a recording composer may spend<br> a great deal of her compositional energy effectively inventing new<br> sounds or combinations of sounds. Of course, this was already well known by the mid sixties: psychedelia <br>expanded not only minds but recording technologies as well. But there was <br>still an assumption that playing with sound itself was a ‘merely’ <br>technical job — something engineers and producers did — as opposed to the serious <br>creative work of writing songs and playing instruments. With Ambient Music, <br>I wanted to suggest that this activity was actually one of the distinguishing characteristics <br>of new music, and could in fact become the main focus of compositional attention.

        <div id="six">
            <p>Studios have also offered composers virtual spaces. Traditional <br>recording put a mike in front of an instrument in a nice-sounding space and recorded the <br>result . What you heard was the instrument and it’s reverberation <br>in that space. By the forties, people were getting a little more <br>ambitious, and starting to invent technologies that could supplement these<br> natural spaces — echo chambers, tape delay systems, etc. A lot of <br>this work was done for radio — to be able to ‘ locate’ characters in different virtual spaces in radio <br>dramas — but it was popular music which really opened the subject up. Elvis<br> and Buddy and Eddy and all the others sang with weird tape repeats <br>on their voices — unlike anything you’d ever hear in nature. Phil Spector and <br>Joe Meek invented their own ‘sound’ — by using combinations of overdubbing, <br>home-made echo units, resonant spaces like staircases and lifts shafts, changing tape-speeds and <br>so on, they were able to make ‘normal’ instruments sound completely new. <br>And all this was before synthesizers and dub reggae ...

        <div id="seven">
            <p>By the early seventies, when I started making records, it was clear <br>that This was where a lot of the action was going to be. It interested me because it <br>suggested moving the process of making music much closer to the process<br> of painting (which I thought I knew something about). <br>New sound-shaping and space-making devices appeared on the market weekly <br>(and still do), synthesizers made their clumsy but crucial debut , and people <br>like me just sat at home night after night fiddling around with all this stuff, amazed at what <br>was now possible, immersed in the new sonic worlds we could create.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="eight">
            <p>And immersion was really the point : we were making music to swim in, <br>to float in, to get lost inside.</p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="nine">
            <p>This became clear to me when I was confined to bed, immobilized by an <br>accident in early 1975. My friend Judy Nylon had visited, and brought with her a <br>record of 17th-century harp music. I asked her to put it on as she left, <br>which she did, but it wasn’t until she’s gone that I <br>realized that the hi-fi was much too quiet and one of the speakers had given <br>up anyway. It was raining hard outside, and I could hardly hear the music above <br>the rain — just the loudest notes, like lit t le crystals, sonic icebergs rising out of the <br>storm. I couldn’t get up and change it, so I Just lay there waiting <br>for my next visit or to come and sort it out, and gradually I was seduced by <br>this listening experience. I realized that this was what I wanted music to <br>be — a place, a feeling, an all-around tint to my sonic environment.</p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="ten">
            <p>After that, in April or May of that year, I made Discreet Music, which <br>I suppose was really my first Ambient record (though the stuff I’d done with the<br> great guitarist Robert Fripp before that gets pretty close). This was a <br>31-minute piece (the longest I could get on a record at <br>the time) which was modal, evenly textured, calm and sonically warm. At the <br>time, it was not a record that received a very warm welcome, and I probably <br>would have hesitated to release it without the encouragement of my friend Peter Schmidt ,<br> the painter. (In fact, it ’s often been painters and writers — people who<br> use • music while they work and want to make for themselves a conducive <br>environment — who’ve first enjoyed and encouraged this work.)

        <div id="eleven">
            <p>In late 1977 I was waiting for a plane in Cologne airport . It was early<br> on a sunny, clear morning, the place was nearly empty, and the space of the <br>building (designed, I believe, by the father of one of the founders of Kraftwerk)<br> was very attractive. I started to wonder what kind of <br>music would sound good in a building like that. I thought, ‘ It has to be <br>interrupt ible (because there’ll be announcements), it has to work outside the <br>frequencies at which people speak, and at different speeds from speech patterns (so as <br>not to confuse communication), and it has to be able to accommodate all the<br> noises that airports produce. And, most importantly for me, it has to<br> have something to do with where you are and what you’re there for — flying, <br>floating and, secretly, flirting with death.’ I thought, ‘I want to make <br>a kind of music that prepares you for dying — that doesn’t<br> get all bright and cheerful and pretend you’re not a little apprehensive,<br> but which makes you say to yourself, <br>“Actually, it’s not that big a deal if I die.”’
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="twelve">
            <p>Thus was born the first Ambient record — Music for Airports — which I <br>released on my own label (called Ambient Records, of course). The Inner sleeve <br>of that release carried my manifesto:
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="thirteen">
            <p>Ambient Music <br>
              The concept of music designed specifically as a background feature in <br>the environment was pioneered by Muzak Inc. in the fifties, and has since come <br>carries are those particularly associated with the kind of material that Muzal Inc. <br>produces — familiar tunes arranged and orchestrated in a <br>lightweight and derivative manner. Understandably, this has led most <br>discerning listeners (and most composers) to dismiss entirely the concept of <br>environmental music as an idea worthy of attention.
              </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="fourteen">
            <p>Over the past three years, I have become interested in the use of music <br>as ambience, and have come to believe that it is possible to produce material<br> that can be used thus without being in any way compromised. To create a distinction <br>between my own experiments in this area and the products <br>of the various purveyors of canned music, I have begun using the term Ambient Music.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="fifteen">
            <p>An ambience is defined as an atmosphere, or a surrounding influence: a tint. <br>My intention is to produce original pieces ostensibly (but not exclusively) <br>for particular times and situations with a view to building up a small but <br>versatile catalogue of environmental music suited to a wide <br>variety of moods and atmospheres.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="sixteen">
            <p>Whereas the extant canned-music companies proceed from the basis of <br>regularizing environments by blanketing their acoustic and atmospheric idiosyncrasies, <br>Ambient Music is intended to enhance these. Whereas conventional <br>background music is produced by stripping away all sense of doubt <br>and uncertainty (and thus all genuine interest) from the music, <br>Ambient Music retains these qualities. And whereas their intention is to ‘brighten’<br> the environment by adding stimulus to it (thus supposedly alleviating <br>the tedium of routine tasks and levelling out the natural ups <br>and downs of the body rhythms), Ambient Music is intended <br>to induce calm and a spaa to think.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="seventeen">
            <p>Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention <br>without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting. <br>
              (September 1978)

        <div id="eighteen">
            <p>Like a lot of the stuff I was doing at the time, this was regarded by many<br> English music critics as a kind of arty joke, and they had a lot of fun with it. <br>I’m therefore pleased that the idea has stuck around so long and<br> keeps sprouting off in all sorts of directions: it comes back <br>around to me like Chinese Whispers — unrecognizable but intriguing. <br>Those early seeds (there were only four releases on the original Ambient Records <br>label — On Land and Music for Airports by me, The Plateaux of Mirror by Harold Budd,<br> and Day of Radiance by Laraaji) have contributed to a rich forest of music.
